# Josh's Emote Server Bot

Hi! This was my first "large" development project. I created a custom bot for my Discord Server which was utilised throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic by 30+ users.

Feel free to review or utilise the source code, but be aware that it may be fairly low quality as this project was started when I was 14! It was created on the 11th of September 2020, and received its last revision on the 28th of February 2022.
